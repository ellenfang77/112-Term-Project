OVERFLOW

About the Project

Overflow is a single-player game that is inspired by the mini-game from an online
kids game called Animal Jam. The goal of this game is to create a continuous, unbroken 
path from the ocean at the top to the ocean at the bottom. Users do this by clicking 
on the tiles so that they rotate 90 degrees clockwise each time. Once a path has
been created, the user clicks "r" to run the water from the top to the bottom. The 
game includes three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium, and Hard. These modes each have
ten levels within them. An increase in difficulty mode means that there are more tiles
to be rotated and more tiles that cannot be used to create the complete path.
